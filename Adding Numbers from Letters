# There are a few assumpitons for this code
# Assumption 1: The length of the numbers and the length of the letters are the same
# Assumption 2: The maximum lenth of the numbers can not exceed 26, the number of unique letters of the alphbet
# Assumption 3: The only operations are addition and subtraction
# Assumption 4: There are only 2 numbers in the final calculation
